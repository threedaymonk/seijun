* There is no border between the title bar and window contents.
* Similarly, there is no border between the bottom border and the window contents, although the size of the handle remains unchanged.
* The window menu icon is slightly different.
* There are no PNG gradient overlays.

h2. Installation

Create a @~/.themes@ directory (if you don't have one already), change into it, and clone the repository.
