h1. Seijun 清純

Seijun is a simple, plain, subtle GTK2 and XFWM4 theme based on Metabox (XFWM) and Innocent (GTK2).

h2. Differences from Metabox

* Window borders are less obtrusive.
* There is no border between the title bar and window contents.
* Similarly, there is no border between the bottom border and the window contents, although the size of the handle remains unchanged.
* The window menu icon is slightly different.
* There are no PNG gradient overlays.

h2. Differences from Innocent

* Scrollbars have the buttons at each end, not grouped at one end.
* The dark colour in the theme is a little warmer.
* There are no shadows on menus and toolbars.

h2. Installation

Create a @~/.themes@ directory (if you don't have one already), change into it, and clone the repository.
